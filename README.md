Working Title

    Diet is 80% of any weight loss goals. It's also, one of the most important factors involved with how you feel, how much energy you have, and your overall wellness. The biggest way to make a change to your diet is actually taking the time to log what you eat. People don't notice what nutrients they are lacking or any patterns they have about eating. Keeping a food log can be tedious. Having to type in and sift through every single ingredient you've used is a big pain. With my app, all you will have to do is take 3 seconds to just tell your phone what you have eaten and with a few clicks your diet and nutrient will be calculated for you!
    With this app you will just need to press a button to talk and then another to select which item relates to what you ate the closest. After that the application will do the rest.
    My APIs  will be the Web Speech API for Chrome and the United States Department of Agriculture Research Service, USDA Food Composition Database. I will also be using HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, and most likely Bootstrap.
